# **Building my Portfolio Website**  
<br>

I made this website for the purpose of learning HTML and CSS frameworks like:  
* React  
* TailwindCSS  
* GSAP 
<br> 

It was so I could have the flexibility to try out different styles and frameworks without the pressure of time constraints that hackathons would have.
